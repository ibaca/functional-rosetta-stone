# Introduction

Java is a multi purpose Object Programming language used in the Industry. 
In Java 8 and later, the language was upgraded with some features oriented 
to add functional capabilities. This repository try to clarify the role of 
functional programming and the benefits for an average Java Developer.

The repository review concepts from other languages like `Scala`, `Haskell`, `Clojure` or `Lisp`
in order to understand the whole functional programming spectrum.

Traditionally, the main benefits from Functional programming languages are:

- First class function
- High-order functions
- Immutable data
- Pure functions
- Recursion
- Manipulation of lists
- Lazy evaluation

When you apply that concepts in Java, some features doesn't match with Java's spirit like  
the concept about `first class function` or `recursion` (language limits in the stack) 
but for the rest of the features, it is possible to be applied.
