# Functional Programming concepts

### Equational reasoning


```
2*x + x/y
= 2*8 + 8/y { x }
= 2*8 + 8/4 { y }
= 16 + 2 { arithmetic }
= 18 { arithmetic }
```

Sometimes the justification is an explicit reference to an equation; thus the
justification { x } means “the equation defining x allows this step to be taken”.
In other cases, where we don’t want to give a formal justification because it is
too trivial and tedious, an informal reason is given, for example { arithmetic
}.
The format for writing a chain of equational reasoning is not rigidly specified. The reasoning above was written with each step on a separate line, with
the justifications aligned to the right. This format is commonly used; it is
compact and readable for many cases.

### Referential Transparency


Referential transparency means that a function call can be replaced by its value 
or another referentially transparent call with the same result.

### Side effects


A side effect is anything a method does besides computing and returning a value. 
Any change of instance or class field values is a side effect, as is drawing something on the screen, 
writing to a file or a network connection.

``` java 
public class SideEffectClass{

    private int state = 0;

    public doSomething(...){//Does not matter
        state ++;
    }
}
```

### Pure functions 



A function is called pure function if it always returns the same result for same argument values 
and it has no side effects like modifying an argument (or global variable) or outputting something. 

``` java  
public int sum(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

### Higher-order functions

A higher order function is a function that either takes a function 
(method) as parameter, or returns a function after its execution.
